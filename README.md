# Little Man Computer Assembly Language

This is my implementation of the LMC assembly language.

This implementation is based on the [LMC specification (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer) and [Peter Higginson's LMC simulator](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc).

See the [examples](examples) directory for example programs.

## Example CLI

I have created a separate repository for the CLI, [lmc-cli](https://github.com/CDE90/lmc-cli).
